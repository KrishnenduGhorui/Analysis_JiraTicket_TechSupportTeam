* Pre-processed data -

  * Mean, Median, Standard deviation of resolution time of each assignee team    
  * Mean reolution time each ticket component wise
  * Separate Scatterplot of resolution time for each assignee team
  * Total count of ticket in specified resolution time range
* Visualization on NPS/feedback rating  
  * Pie plot showing percentage of NPS feedback rating provided and not provided 
  * Barplot with count of NPS rate(1-10) provided
  * Countplot of NPS rating label(Promoter, Passive, Detractor) each assignee team wise 
  * Regression plot of feedback rating and Resolution time 
  * Barplot with count and Percentage of Count of NPS rate category, Resolution time range wise
* Heatmap showing correlation between fetaures 
* Lineplot of Created and Resolved ticket count in each day in a month 
* Lineplot of Created and Resolved ticket count in each month 
* Countplot of ticket SLA met and breached in a year 
* Lineplot with count of ticket SLA met and breached in each month
